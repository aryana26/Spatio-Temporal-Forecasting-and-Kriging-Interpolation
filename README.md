# Spatiotemporal Forecasting and Kriging-Based Interpolation of PM2.5
![Predicted PM2.5 Animation](bihar_pollution2.gif)
This repository contains work from the **Centre of Excellence ATMAN, National Aerosol Facility, IIT Kanpur**, focused on predicting **PM2.5 concentrations at unknown locations** using a range of statistical, machine learning, and graph-based methods.  

Currently, the repository includes code for **spatial interpolation and Kriging methods**. Upcoming modules will integrate advanced forecasting approaches including **XGBoost, IGNNK, and graph neural networkâ€“based models**.

##  Project Overview

Air quality monitoring networks in India have limited spatial coverage. To better understand and forecast pollution exposure, we aim to predict **PM2.5 at unmonitored locations** using:

- **Kriging & Universal Kriging**  
  - Classical geostatistical interpolation techniques that leverage spatial correlation.  
  - Variogram modeling with spherical, exponential, and Gaussian structures.  
  - External drift inclusion using meteorological parameters such as temperature, wind components (`u10`, `v10`).  

- **Machine Learning Approaches**  
  - **XGBoost regression** for fast, flexible learning from sensor and meteorological data.  
  - **Graph-based methods** including **IGNNK** (Inductive Graph Neural Network for Kriging) that exploit the sensor network as a graph for more robust spatial interpolation.  

- **Spatiotemporal Forecasting**
-  Exploring Foundational Models like ST-LLM- (work ongoing, hence not added in repo yet)
  - We will be leveraging **u10 (eastâ€“west wind)** and **v10 (northâ€“south wind)** components from ERA5 reanalysis data to capture pollutant transport and dispersion effects.

##  Visualizations

### 1. Sensor Grid Layout
Below is an example plot of the **sensor locations and generated grid points** used for interpolation.  
In the notebooks, this can be interacted with as a **live object** for exploring specific sensor points and their neighborhoods.

### 2. Pollution Animation (GIF)
We generate animated spatial maps showing **predicted PM2.5 concentrations across Bihar** on a **500m Ã— 500m grid**.  
This GIF illustrates **pollution dynamics and spatial gradients** predicted using Kriging-based interpolation:

### 3. Prediction Trends
The following figure shows how the models learn **temporal cycles** of PM2.5 â€” capturing **hourly variations** (diurnal cycles) and **monthly trends**.
